Two squares is a program that writes prime numbers under a given number n ∈ ℕ as the sum of two squares.

The program generates a list of prime = j + k for each prime and creates a text file. Some primes may have more than one sum. 

The values for j and k are either:
1) a square, s = { n² | n ∈ ℕ }
2) a surd square, which is the square of a multiple of a surd, that is, 
   
   ss = { (n√p)² | n ∈ ℕ, p ∈ ℙ }, or equivalently, 
   
   ss = { n²p | n ∈ ℕ, p ∈ ℙ }.

Difference is a similar program, but it instead writes a prime as the difference of two primes. It generates a list prime = k - j for each prime and creates a text file.
