Currently, it generates three lists as a text file:
1) primes as the sum of two squares or surd squares
2) primes as the sum of a square and 1
3) primes as the difference of a prime and 2

A surd square is the square of a multiple of a surd, that is, 
   
   ss = { (n√p)² | n ∈ ℕ, p ∈ ℙ }, or equivalently, 
   
   ss = { n²p | n ∈ ℕ, p ∈ ℙ }.

Now updated to reduce the number of primes needed for surd squares by determining least quadratic residues.
