# hi

# this program will generate a list of complex factors of primes
# the factors will be of the form (a+bi)(a-bi)
# where a and b belong to L, i is the square root of -1
# and L is a list that contains squares and "surd squares"

# important definitions

# a square is not a circle
# a surd is the square root of a prime
# a surd square is the square of a integer multiple of a surd
